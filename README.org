* My texmf files
Here are all the user packages and configurations I use in my =texmf= folder. It
complies with the standard folder structure. Feel free to use whatever nuggets
you find useful.

A useful file in here is my style for notes [[https://github.com/gcman/texmf/blob/master/tex/latex/local/og-notes.org][og-notes]], inspired
by =tufte-latex=.
