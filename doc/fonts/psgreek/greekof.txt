GREEK OLD FACE AND GREEK OLD FACE C FONTS

These fonts have the character set of the Greek font supplied with the
wgreek19.zip shareware for Windows, with the additions listed below. Only the
Type 1 version of the font has the characters with codes below 32; all these
characters are printable in Word for Windows and many other Windows
applications. TrueType fonts can't display characters under 32.

Greek Old Face, for the Anglophone market, has:
c-shaped epsilon
closed theta
straight kappa
straight rho
tall phi

Greek Old Face C, for the Continental market, has:
8-shaped epsilon
open theta
x-shaped kappa
curly rho
low-topped phi

In each font, the national set that is not used may be found on the codes
below 32.

Kerning: all unaccented lower case letters are kerned relative to each other,
so that numerals can be printed properly. Otherwise, only pairs that actually
occur in classical Greek are kerned. Word for Windows cannot use kerning in
TrueType fonts that do not have standard encoding - as the Greek fonts do
not. The fonts are designed to look OK without kerning, though obviously
kerning improves letter spacing.


THESE FONTS ARE SHAREWARE

They took a lot of work to design, and I would be touchingly grateful if you
could see your way to paying a small fee for them. So please send a cheque
for $20 or equivalent in other currency (or œ10 sterling) to:

Ralph Hancock
17 Queen's Gate Place
London SW7 5NY
United Kingdom

Please get in touch if you want a different version of the font. I will
recode it, free, to any coding you like - as long as you tell me EXACTLY what
character set you want. Mac versions can also be done, but some discussion
will be necessary about the character set. Note that this is a Greek-only
font, so I can't make up a roman-and-Greek character set like the Windows
modern Greek one.

By all means pass the font on to other people but, if you do, be sure to
include this note with it.
